# unity-ml-agents-donut-collector
Using the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit, a neural network was trained to navigate an environment and complete a simple task. This repo contains the C# classes that I wrote to define the environment and agent behavior. It does not contain all the associated Unity files like scenes, prefabs, and meshes needed to make it work in the engine.
